# DriverPass

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?<br/>
The creators of DriverPass noticed a trend of students that were failing driving tests to get their driver's license, so they wanted to create a system that would allow students to be able to take practice driving tests online and to schedule practice driving sessions with certified drivers.<br/>
What did you do particularly well?<br/>
I feel one of the things I did particularly well was going through the interview and figuring out exactly what things the customer wanted to see in their system and laying out those requirements in a cohesive way that made the system flow well.<br/>
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?<br/>
One of the things I would choose to revise is the use case diagram, I feel mine was not as specific as it could have been with the functions in the use case.<br/>
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?<br/>
The main way I interpreted the user's needs with this system was by imagining myself using the system and thinking about specific things that I would want to see in the system were I a user. It is important to consider the user's needs because the customer may not have taken some user needs into consideration when laying out the requirements for the system, and ultimately the system is made for the user's experience.<br/>
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?<br/>
The approach I like to use when designing software is to first collect the requirements that the customer would like to see, then take those requirements and plan them out in a way that makes sense to a user of the system. After the use cases are planned out I do a UML class diagram to make sense of the specific classes, functions, and transfer of data that is happening in the system.
